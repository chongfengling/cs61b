# CS61B Data Structures, Spring 2021 by Josh Hug

## Attempted projects

### [Project 0: 2048](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj0/proj0) (full marks)
`
Get familiar with Java and the various tools used in the course like the IntelliJ IDE and JUnit for writing and running unit tests.
`
### [Project 1: Data Structures](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj1/proj1) (full marks)
`
Build implementations of a “Double Ended Queue” using both lists and arrays in a package that other classes can use. The project is roughly split into two halves: the data structure portion and the application portion.
`
### [Project 2: Gitlet](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2) (ongoing)
`
Implement a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. This is smaller and simpler, however, so we have named it Gitlet.
